# My Data Engineering Journey

**Start Date:** [Today's date]
**Target:** Data Engineer by June 2027
Finally starting to understand and implement functions. Starting to build my own file for referencing that I can go back to so I don't constantly have to remake the functions. Going to start with just basic calculations ones but I hope to add to it as time goes on, once it starts getting more complex I'll need to look into how to organize and keep them readable and usable but that is a problem for later. Soon I want to build the project that I couldn't for the file organizer and then start on the job finder
