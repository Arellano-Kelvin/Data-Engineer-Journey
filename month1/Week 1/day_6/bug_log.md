# Bug Log

## [02/14/2026] - [terminal/bash]
### Error Message:
practice\exercism> exorcism -w
spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ exorcism -w
+ ~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (exorcism:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
 
### What I Tried:
when saving exercises to a local environment I tried to change the path to coincide with what I have in general practice instead of the default desktop folder, because I didn't put the path of the file after I got this error once I put the full path name it worked
